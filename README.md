This work is associated with work on Domain Generating Algorithm (DGA) malware detection. DGA detection is based on deep learning hybrid model of CNN, LSTM and Attention models. This hybrid model classifies legitimate DNS samples from DGA generated malicious DNS samples. DGA sample are taken from a publically available repo from Bamabanek while legitmate ot benign DNS sample are taken from ALEXA top one million domain names.
