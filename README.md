## DGA-taxonmy-with-DL-and-AF
This work is associated with work on Domain Generating Algorithm (DGA) malware detection. DGA detection is based on deep learning hybrid model of CNN, LSTM and Attention models. This hybrid model classifies legitimate DNS samples from DGA generated malicious DNS samples. DGA sample are taken from a publically available repo from Bamabanek while legitmate benign DNS sample are taken from ALEXA top one million domain names. 
Since inception of deep learning models of LSTM and CNN, shallow nwteorks models like random forest classifier, hidden markove models and n-gram models are outperformed by these deep learning models.
